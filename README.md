What is worldtoscreen? W2S will give you screen coordinates, it can be used for esp and aimbot.

How to use:
1. Find models in your game, (press INSERT for menu). 
2. Try to bruteforce WorldViewCBnum, ProjCBnum & matProjnum. Text will be displayed on models position. If positions are wrong try other worldtoscreen math/method (google).
3. Press END to log highlighted models to log.txt.
